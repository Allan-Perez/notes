# Basic Topology and Metric Spaces 3H (Honours)
Lecturer: Dr. Christian Korff [Christian.Korff@glasgow.ac.uk]
Credits: 10


2 lectures a week. Recommendation: Reading of the material before/after lectures.

Office Hours: 
Recommended text: Introduction to Metric Spaces and Topological Spaces
(Sutherland).

Assessments: MCQ fortnightly, starting Thursday 27th January, having 5 in total.
The top 4 marks will count towards 10% of the final grade. The 90% of the grade
is weighed on the final exam. These MCQs will be done on 9-10am, and must be
completed during this time slot. To prepare for MCQs, attempt the relevant
tutorial questions.

These questions are the Peer Marking Exercises, which can be freely done, but
encouraged to prepare as if it was a feedback exercise. These are required to
have prepared before the tutorials. These tutorials are done fortnightly.

Lectures are pre-recorded, released weekly.

Syllabus:
1. Definition of differentiability for complex functions of one complex var.
   Cauchy-Riemann Equtions
2. Computation of elementary complex functions, def/computation of complex log
3. Integrals of continuous functions along curves in complex plane.
4. Cauchy's theorem for close paths, related results
5. Nature of singularities, and residue computation of suitable meromorphic
   functions. Residue theorem. Use to compute real integrals.
6. Conformal maps. Bilinear maps, Riemann mapping theorem.
