	shorttitle = {Algorithms for quantum computation},
	abstract = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The security of the {RSA} lies in an algorithm based on Euler’s Theorem and Fermat’s Little Theorem. This cryptosystem has proven to be unbreakable, as long as it is implemented correctly, for over 30 years. This system is a classic example of how the theorems of ancient mathematicians used to advance mathematical thought in history are being used to advance technology today.},
