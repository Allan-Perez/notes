\section{Lecture 4 - 27 Sep 2021}
Let $y_1,y_2$ be solutions of $L[y]=0$ throughout. We know that if they are linearly
independent then their Wronskian $W(y_1,y_2)\neq 0\forall t\in I$.
\begin{definition}
  The two solutions above are called \emph{fundamental solutions} of the ODE if they are
  both solutions and they are linearly independent.
  \label{fundamentalSolutions}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The general solution of the homogeneous ODE is a 2-parameter family of functions, 
  $y_{g} (t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t)$
  Where $c_1,c_2\in\RR$ are arbitrary constants and $y_1,y_2$ are fundamental solutions.
  \label{familyOfSolutions}
\end{definition}

The rest is the exact same as in Lecture 2.
